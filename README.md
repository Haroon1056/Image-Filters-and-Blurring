# Image Filters and Blurring (OpenCV)

This project demonstrates fundamental and intermediate image processing techniques using **OpenCV**.  
It covers a wide range of operations including filtering, blurring, edge detection, transformations, pyramids, histograms, morphological operations, and template matching.  
A **mini-project** on shape detection is also included.
